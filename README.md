# Capital App - Flutter Project

Welcome to **Capital App**, a Flutter project crafted to showcase a typical workflow and code structure for a production-grade mobile application. This README will walk you through the major phases of development, from design to delivery, along with a step-by-step guide for setting up the project and structuring the codebase.

## Project Overview

**Capital App** is used here as an example project name, but feel free to adapt these instructions and folder structures to your own requirements. Below is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) illustration we will refer to throughout this documentation:

## Design & Project Phases

Our development process typically consists of three main phases: **Design**, **Develop**, and **Deliver**.

### 1. Design

1. **Wireframe**  
   - Gather all wireframes or early sketches from the design team to understand the appâ€™s flow and basic layout.
   - Validate that all screens are accounted for, and nothing is missing in terms of user journey.

2. **Design**  
   - The design team provides high-fidelity mockups (Figma, Sketch, etc.).
   - Verify you have **all design resources** (icons, images, fonts).  
   - If the app is multilingual, confirm you have localized/translated designs for each language.  
   
   Example localized design screenshots:

   If there is a **design prototype** that shows interactive navigation, confirm you have it for better clarity of transitions and workflows:

### 2. Develop

1. **Frontend**  
   - Build the UI with Flutter, ensuring it matches the provided design specs.  
   - Integrate the necessary **state management** approach (e.g., Provider, Bloc, Riverpod, etc.).

2. **Backend**  
   - Coordinate with the backend team (or set up your own backend) to ensure the APIs are documented.  
   - If using serverless or 3rd-party APIs, integrate using the chosen HTTP client (like `dio`).

### 3. Deliver

1. **Testing**  
   - Conduct thorough QA testing.  
   - Ensure integration tests, widget tests, and/or unit tests are performed on critical flows (e.g., login, payment).

2. **Deployment**  
   - Prepare Android and iOS release versions.  
   - Follow appropriate app store guidelines (Google Play Store, Apple App Store).

## Project Timeline & Documentation

It is essential to provide the **Project Manager (PM)** with:

- A detailed **Project Timeline**.  
- Any **Project Documentation** (requirements docs, user stories, etc.).  
- **Design/Prototype** files (XD, Figma, etc.).  
- Use the following as a simple **time-estimation rule** per module:
  - **1 week** for design per module  
  - **1 week** for state management per module  
  - **1 week** for API integration  

For more complex or critical modules, tasks are managed **Task-by-Task** on a **Jira Board**. Always read [**How to Estimate Time for a Project**](https://blog.flutter.wtf/how-to-estimate-time-for-a-project/) before committing to any timeline.

## Team, Assets, and Other Critical Details

- Make sure you identify key stakeholders: **Developers**, **Designers**, **QA Engineers**, **Project Managers**, etc.  
- Verify you have access to all **assets** (icons, fonts, images, prototypes).  
- Clarify **version control** processes, **branching strategies**, and **deployment pipelines**.  
- Decide on the **communication channels** (Slack, Teams, etc.) to keep the team in sync.

## Project Setup

### 1. Create a New Flutter Project

Use your terminal to create a new project:

```bash
flutter create capital_app
